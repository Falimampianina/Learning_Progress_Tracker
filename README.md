# Learning_Progress_Tracker
This is a little tracking tool for an online learning platform, which gives Java, DSA, Databases and Spring courses.
Students have to sign in on the platform with a valid email and name (only english alphabet granted) by typing 'add students'.
Students are stored with their names, email and ids, and have their points recorded for every course they take and exercices they do (by using typing 'add points').
This tool can print the statistics about the courses, which course is the most popular one, the less popular, the hardest and the easiest one, and so on.
This tool can print also statistics about one course, like the points from every enrolled students in this course.
Feel free to test.
